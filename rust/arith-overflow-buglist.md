List of Bugs uncovered in Rust via arithmetic overflow checking
===============================================================

This document is a list of bugs that were uncovered during the
implementation and deployment of arithmetic overflow checking.

This list is restricted solely to *legitimate* bugs. Cases
where the overflow was benign (e.g. the computed value is
unused), transient (e.g. the computed wrapped value is
guaranteed to be brought back into the original range, such as
in `unsigned - 1 + provably_positive`), or silly (random
non-functional code in the tests or documentation) are not
included in the list.

However, extremely rare or obscure corner cases are considered
legitimate bugs. (We begin with such a case.)

 1. `impl core::iter::RandomAccessIter for core::iter::Rev`

    if one calls the `iter.idx(index)` with `index <= amt`,
    then it calls the wrapped inner iterstor with a wrapped
    around value. The contract for `idx` does say that it
    does need to handle out-of-bounds inputs, so this
    appeared benign at first, but there is the corner case
    of an iterator that actually covers the whole range
    of indices, which would then return `Some(_)` here when
    (pnkfelix thinks) `None` should be expected.

 2. `std::sys::windows::time::SteadyTime`

    `fn ns` was converting a tick count `t` to nanoseconds
    via the computation `t * 1_000_000_000 / frequency()`;
    but the multiplication there can overflow, thus losing
    the high-order bits.

    Full disclosure: This bug was known prior to landing
    arithmetic overflow checks, and filed as:

    https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17845

    Despite being filed, it was left unfixed for months,
    despite the fact that the overflow would start
    occurring after 2 hours of machine uptime, according to:

    https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22788

    pnkfelix included it on this list because having arithmetic
    overflow forces such bugs to be fixed in some manner
    rather than ignored.

 3. `std::rt::lang_start`
    The runtime startup uses a fairly loose computation to
    determine the stack extent to pass to
    record_os_managed_stack_bounds (which sets up guard
    pages and fault handlers to deal with call stack over-
    or underflows).

    In this case, the arithmetic involved was actually
    *overflowing*, in this calculation:

    ```
    let top_plus_20k = my_stack_top + 20000;
    ```

    pnkfelix assumes that in practice this would lead to us
    attempting to install a guard page starting from some
    random location, rather than the actual desired
    address range. While the lack of a guard page in the
    right spot is probably of no consequence here (assuming
    that the OS is already going to stop us from actually
    attempting to write to stack locations resulting from
    overflow if that ever occurs), attempting to install a
    guard page on a random unrelated address range seems
    completely bogus.
    pnkfelix only observed this bug when building a 32-bit
    Rust on a 64-bit Linux host via cross-compilation.

    So, probably qualifies a rare bug.

    UPDATE: In hindsight, one might argue this should be
    reclassified as a transient overflow, because the whole 
    computation in context is:

    ```
    let my_stack_bottom =
        my_stack_top + 20000 - OS_DEFAULT_STACK_ESTIMATE;
    ```

    where `OS_DEFAULT_STACK_ESTIMATE` is a large value
    (> 1mb).

    However, my claim is that this code is playing guessing
    games; do we really know that the stack is sufficiently
    large that the computation above does not *underflow*?

    So pnkfelix is going to leave it on this list, at least
    for now. (pnkfelix subsequently changed the code to use
    saturated arithmetic in both cases, though obviously
    that could be tweaked a bit.)

 4. struct order of evaluation

    There is an explanatory story here:

    https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23112

    In short, one of our tests was quite weak and not
    actually checking the computed values. But
    arithmetic-overflow checking immediately pointed
    out an attempt to reserve a ridiculous amount
    of space within a `Vec`. (This was on an experimental
    branch of the codebase where we would fill with
    a series of `0xC1` bytes when a value was dropped, rather
    than filling with `0x00` bytes.)

    It is actually quite likely that this test would still
    have failed without the arithmetic overflow checking,
    but it probably would have been much harder to diagnose
    since the panic would have happened at some arbitrary
    point later in the control flow.

 5. Servo: test for lowercase ASCII chars

    Servo contained the following [code][ascii-before] to test whether a char
    `ch` is in the range `['a', 'z']`.

    ```
    ch as u8 - b'a' < 26
    ```

    This is incorrect because the conversion to `u8` loses the high bits, so
    characters like `'\u{161}'` test positive as lowercase ASCII letters
    (because `'\u{161}' as u8` == `0x61` == `'a'`).

    It's also hard to reason about because the subtraction may overflow,
    though in this particular case the overflow does not lead to any bugs.

    This was [fixed][ascii-after] by changing the test to:

    ```
    ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z'
    ```

    On closer inspection, overflow checking does not actually prevent the bug
    here, since it panics on the subtraction overflow (not a "real" bug) but
    not the conversion overflow.  But it caused us to rewrite this buggy code
    and notice the real bug.
